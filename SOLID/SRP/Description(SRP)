S-SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPAL
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles in Low-Level Design (LLD).

It states 2 key principles.
1)Your class or method should have only one reason to change.
2)Your class or method should have only one responsibility to take care of.

- Improves Maintainability: If a class has multiple responsibilities, modifying one part might unintentionally affect another.
- Enhances Readability: Code is easier to understand when each class has a clear, singular purpose.
- Reduces Coupling: Helps in keeping different functionalities independent, making the system more flexible.
