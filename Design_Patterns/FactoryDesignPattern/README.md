Factory Design Pattern:
The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps in creating objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. Instead of using the new keyword to create objects directly, a factory method encapsulates object creation, making the code more maintainable, scalable, and loosely coupled.

Why Use the Factory Pattern?
- Encapsulation of Object Creation – Keeps the logic of object creation separate from client code.
- Flexibility – Makes it easy to introduce new object types without modifying existing client code.
- Loose Coupling – Reduces dependencies between classes, making changes easier in the future.
- Improved Maintainability – Helps in following the Open-Closed Principle from SOLID principles.
