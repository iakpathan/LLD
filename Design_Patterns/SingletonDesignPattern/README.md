The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Why Use Singleton?
- Ensures a Single Instance – Prevents multiple instances in memory, saving resources.
- Global Access Point – The instance is accessible across the application.
- Controlled Access – Helps manage shared resources like configuration settings, logging, and database connections.
 Singleton Implementation in Java
 Step 1: Private Constructor
- Restricts instantiation from other classes.
 Step 2: Static Instance
- Holds the single instance.
 Step 3: Public Method
- Provides controlled access to the instance.
Applications:
 1. Logging Frameworks
- Ensures only one logger instance writes logs to a file or console.
- Example: Log4J, java.util.logging
2. Database Connection Management
- Manages connections to databases, preventing redundant connections.
- Example: JDBC Connection Pool
3. Configuration Management
- Stores global settings (app properties, API keys) in one instance shared across the application.
- Example: Spring Configuration Classe
4.Authentication and Security
- Manages a single security context, ensuring centralized access control.
- Example: JWT Token Manager
5. Network Connections & API Clients
- Maintains one HTTP client instance, reducing redundant socket connections.
- Example: Retrofit, OkHttp, Singleton API Client

Benefits of Singleton Pattern
✔ Reduces Memory Overhead – Prevents multiple object creation.
✔ Ensures Consistency – A single instance maintains a global state.
✔ Optimizes Resource Usage – Prevents duplicate connections or configurations.
